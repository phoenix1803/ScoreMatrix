        "reference_answer": "Calorific value is the amount of heat released when a substance undergoes complete combustion.  It's typically expressed as energy per unit mass or volume.  Factors affecting it include the chemical composition of the substance, its moisture content, and the completeness of combustion.",

            "Expand on the explanation of how chemical composition affects calorific value.  Explain that different elements and their bonds release different amounts of energy upon combustion.  Provide examples (e.g.",
            "hydrocarbons have higher calorific values than alcohols).",
            "Elaborate on the effect of moisture content. Explain that water absorbs heat during combustion",
            "thus reducing the net heat released and consequently the calorific value. Quantify this effect if possible.",
            "Discuss the impact of impurities. Impurities can lower the calorific value by diluting the combustible material or by requiring additional energy for their combustion.",
            "Explain the effect of the completeness of combustion.  Incomplete combustion produces less heat because some of the fuel is not fully oxidized.  Discuss the products of incomplete combustion (CO",
            "soot) and their impact.",

            "coal",
            "natural gas) and relate their differences to their chemical composition and moisture content.",

        "question": "what is cracking of crude oil ? List its types",
        "reference_answer": "Cracking is a refining process that breaks down large, complex hydrocarbon molecules in crude oil into smaller, more useful molecules like gasoline and other fuels.  This process involves high temperatures and pressures, sometimes with catalysts.  There are two main types: thermal cracking, which uses heat alone, and catalytic cracking, which employs catalysts to facilitate the process at lower temperatures.  Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) is a common and highly efficient variation of catalytic cracking.  Hydrocracking combines cracking with hydrogenation to produce higher-quality products and reduce unwanted byproducts.",
