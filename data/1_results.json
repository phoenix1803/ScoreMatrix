        "reference_answer": "Caking coal, a type of bituminous coal, softens and melts upon heating, allowing it to fuse together into a solid mass called coke.  Coking coal is a specific type of caking coal that meets stringent quality standards for use in coke ovens for steel production.  These standards relate to factors like volatile matter and ash content.  Essentially, all coking coal is caking coal, but not all caking coal is coking coal.",

        "question": "what is cracking of crude oil ? List its types",
        "reference_answer": "Cracking is a process in petroleum refining where large, complex hydrocarbon molecules in crude oil are broken down into smaller, more useful molecules like gasoline and other fuels.  This is achieved through high temperatures and pressures, sometimes with the aid of catalysts.  Two main types are thermal cracking, which uses heat alone, and catalytic cracking, employing catalysts to enhance the process and produce a higher yield of desired products.  Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) is a prevalent and highly efficient form of catalytic cracking.  Hydrocracking, a variation, uses hydrogen gas under high pressure and temperature to further refine the products and reduce the amount of undesirable byproducts.",
